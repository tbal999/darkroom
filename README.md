# darkroom
A console based dungeon crawler game

The aim of the game is to get as many points as possible.
Press w, s, a, d to move around. 
Every time you complete a dungeon, you gain 2 points.
Every time you kill a monster, you gain a point.
The dungeons are randomly sized,
and the creatures/items you find are randomly scattered in the dungeon.
